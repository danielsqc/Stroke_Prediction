# Stroke Prediction

## Context

This project aims to predict Stroke occurrences based on several biological parameters and compare the result from different models. For that, an ANN (Artificial Neural Networks), a Decision Tree model, and an SVM (Support Vector Machines) were implemented.

## Dataset

This project is based on the data avaiable on the [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset), found on Kaggle.
