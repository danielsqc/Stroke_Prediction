# Stroke Prediction

## Context

This project aims to predict Stroke occurencies, based on several biological parameters, and compare the result of different models. For that, were implemented an ANN (Artificial Neural Networks), a Decision Tree model, and a SVM (Support Vector Machines). 

## Dataset

This project is based on the data avaiable on the [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset), found on Kaggle.
